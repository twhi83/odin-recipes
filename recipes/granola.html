    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I started my vegan journey, I would seek out many recipe ideas for breakfast.  I had a subscription to a site that provided hundreds of them.  One recipe that I came across was this granola cereal.  The first time I made it, I fell in love!  It was quick, simple, kept me full for a long time.  I made a couple of small changes, to account for the ingredients that I had on-hand.</p>
    
    <p>Nonetheless, it still tastes amazing!  I make this granola at least once a week.  My kids even love it.  I'll eat it for breakfast, adding it to a bowl and pouring milk over it.  I will top it with sliced bananas.  Feel free to substitute the bananas with strawberries, blueberries, or whatever your heart desires.  I'll even snack on it throughout the day.  Below are the simple ingredients for your tasty, fulfilling breakfast.  Enjoy!</p>
