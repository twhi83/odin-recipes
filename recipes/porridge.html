    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple porridge was another go-to breakfast meal for me in my vegan journey.  The sweetness, the tartness of the apple, the crunchiness of the pecans...all go together so well in this recipe.</p>
    <p>You can use green apples, honey crisp apples (my absolute FAVE), or whatever apples you have on hand or love.  The recipe calls for almond milk, but I've also made it with oat milk and it still tasted delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>2 tbs chia seeds</li>
        <li>2 tbs almond butter</li>
        <li>3 dates, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbs agave syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 apple, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients except the pecans into a blender</li>
        <li>Blend until well mixed</li>
        <li>Add to a bowl and top with desired amount of pecans</li>
    </ol>
